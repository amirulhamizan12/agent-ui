# Realtime Studio — Voice-Driven Browser‑Use Agent (for #nicehack69)

---

**Speech → Web → Done.**  
*Sets a new bar for Browser‑Use agents: real control, real artifacts, real time — PRs, bookings, filings — not another chat demo.*

## 🌟 The 30‑second pitch

You speak. The agent navigates the web through Browser‑Use, clicks buttons, fills forms, scrapes results, and returns artifacts you can share — PRs, GitHub comments, bookings, and reports. It’s a voice‑first control plane for the browser that turns "do this online" into done.

## 🚀 What we built (and why it matters)

Realtime Studio is a production‑quality, voice‑driven Browser‑Use agent. It blends live speech understanding (Gemini) with real browser control (Browser‑Use v2) and a clear operator UI so judges can watch the agent work, step by step, and verify outcomes.

### 🎯 Core capabilities
- **Voice‑in, Action‑out**: Live mic streaming to Gemini; the model emits explicit action tags; Browser‑Use executes them.
- **True browser control**: Sessions, live view, highlight elements, vision, screenshots, and resilient stop/resume.
- **Outcome artifacts**: The UI aggregates steps and output into shareable reports — designed for PRs/issues and demo clips.


## 🎬 Flagship demos (judge‑friendly and viral‑ready)

### 1) Accessibility Fixer Agent → audits and opens a PR
- You say: "Audit `example.com` and fix low‑hanging issues."
- Agent does: navigate a11y tools, capture issues, fork repo via GitHub web, apply simple fixes (alt/aria/heading), open a **PR**, attach a **report** with screenshots.
- Judge sees: live steps, a clean report, and a real PR link.

### 2) Bug Reproducer & Issue Filer → reproduces, records, comments
- You say: "Reproduce this GitHub issue and post evidence." (paste issue URL)
- Agent does: follow steps, record console/network + screenshots, compile a **markdown report**, and **comment back on the issue** with artifacts.
- Judge sees: reliable repro, clear evidence, and a live issue comment link.

## 🔮 The Bigger Picture: Towards General AI Agents

This project is just the **beginning**. Inspired by groundbreaking AI agents like [Manus AI](https://www.manusai.io) and [Loveable](https://loveable.dev), we're building toward something much bigger:

### **Phase 1: Realtime Studio** ✅
*Current implementation - voice commands for web automation*

### **Phase 2: Multi-Platform AI Agent** 🚧
*Integration with mobile apps, desktop software, and IoT devices*

### **Phase 3: General Purpose AI Assistant** 🔮
*Autonomous task planning and execution across all digital platforms*

### **The Vision: Your Personal AI Co-Pilot**
Imagine an AI that doesn't just respond to commands, but **anticipates your needs**:

- **Proactive Assistance**: "I noticed you're researching laptops - here are 3 deals that just went live"
- **Cross-Platform Intelligence**: "I've updated your calendar, booked your flight, and sent the confirmation to your team"
- **Learning & Adaptation**: "Based on your preferences, I've found a new restaurant you'll love"

## 🏆 Why this wins #nicehack69

- **Dreams big, delivers now**: Voice‑first assistants are inevitable; this one already turns speech into verifiable web outcomes.
- **Core to Browser‑Use**: Sessions, tasks, live control, and step telemetry showcase the SDK’s strengths (and surface feedback).
- **No bullshit**: If a text model alone could do it, we didn’t build it. Every demo ends with a shareable artifact (PR, issue, or report).
- **Judge‑ready UX**: Live iframe, step gallery, status indicators, and exportable results make the demo obvious and compelling.

## 🛠 How it works (under the hood)

### **Architecture Overview**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Speech + Text**: Gemini 2.0 Flash Live over WebSockets for low‑latency input/output
- **Browser Automation**: Browser‑Use API v2 for intelligent web interaction
- **Audio Processing**: Custom Web Audio API worklets for real‑time streaming
- **State Management**: React Context with sophisticated task orchestration

### **Key Features**
- 🎤 **Real-time Voice Input**: Continuous speech recognition with visual feedback
- 🧠 **Intelligent Action Parsing**: AI-powered command interpretation and task planning
- 🌐 **Live Browser Automation**: Real-time web interaction with step-by-step visualization
- 🔊 **Natural Voice Responses**: High-quality text-to-speech with multiple voice options
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized**: Efficient WebSocket connections and audio streaming

### **Browser-Use Integration**
Our implementation showcases Browser‑Use's full potential:
- **Session Management**: Persistent browser sessions for complex multi‑step tasks
- **Real‑time Monitoring**: Live view of automation progress with step‑by‑step breakdown
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and user feedback systems
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle concurrent users and complex workflows

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Gemini AI API key
- Browser-Use API key

### **Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-studio-hackathon.git
cd realtime-studio-hackathon

# Install dependencies

NEXT_PUBLIC_BROWSER_USE_API_KEY=your_browser_use_api_key
```

## 🎯 What judges will see in 2 minutes

1) You say a task out loud.
2) The agent opens a live browser view and performs the steps (clicks, forms, navigation, screenshots).
3) A tangible artifact appears: a PR link, an issue comment, or a polished report you can share on X.

## 📊 Benchmarks that matter (for live demos)

- **Speech latency**: typically < 200ms
- **Action cadence**: ~1–2s/step in Browser‑Use live sessions
- **Result time**: < 10s for common multi‑step flows

## 🤝 Contributing and feedback

This project was built for #nicehack69. We want your toughest sites, your worst UX, and your bug reports. Open an issue, share a URL, or propose a demo challenge — the agent should handle it.

Areas to contribute:
- Voice command patterns and action prompting
- Robustness across tricky UIs (iframes, shadow DOM, virtualized lists)
- Artifact exporters (GitHub PR/Issue helpers, report generators, clip makers)
